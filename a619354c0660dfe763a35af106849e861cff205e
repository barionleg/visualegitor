      "message": "This is too early. When you drop, onDocumentDrop in ce.Surface runs before the dragend event is fired, and it ends up calling clearHighlights which unbinds the dragend handler, so the dragend event is never received by anything. This results in a bug where if you drag and drop once, the context goes away and never reappears, because it believes you\u0027re still dragging and hides itself.",

      "message": "Actually the problem is the entire node is destroyed by the onDocumentDrop. Rather than change that order of events I\u0027m just documenting that onFocusableDragEnd only fires if no relocation took place, and triggering endRelocation in onDocumentDrop instead.",
