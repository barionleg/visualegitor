      "message": "Something to note by the way as to why I couldn\u0027t have modified mediawiki/extensions/Cite to instead change the InternalList key of the changed reference: a key change never actually propagates to other references, since VisualEditor will find no other references under the new key (since it searches for the *current* key of the reference, not the old one). There\u0027s also no inbuilt way to manually change the literal key of an existing key. That means whenever a reference is modified, it splits the reference as if it were an entirely new one. This leads to duplicate references under different names, which is unacceptable.",
