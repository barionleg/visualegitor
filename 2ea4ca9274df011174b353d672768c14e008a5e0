      "message": "This line seems slightly odd since there wouldn\u0027t be anything to clear if these are both false. Though that itself would just be an optimisation / code brevity, it looks like this would actually break since the $sizeText property is conditionally defined in the constructor:\n\n\n if ( this.showSizeLabel || this.showScaleLabel ) {\n     this.$sizeText \u003d this.$( \u0027\u003cspan\u003e\u0027 );\n     this.$sizeLabel \u003d this.$( \u0027\u003cdiv\u003e\u0027 ).append( this.$sizeText );\n }\n\nThough it seems this would already break considering this.$sizeLabel is also being accessed unconditionally.\n\nIs it reasonable for a subclass to disable both options?",

Note that if they chose only scale and original dimensions were loaded async, then we would want to show nothing until those were loaded.",
