      "message": "When we\u0027re doing the paste handling, which handler gets used in cases with multiple mime types is dependent on the order we\u0027ve written them down in. There\u0027s not (that I saw) an equivalent order available by interrogating dataTransferHandlerFactory, and taking them randomly risks the text/html order winding up being used when there\u0027s a more-specific one available.\n\nAn alternative that I actually kinda wrote into this patch is the one used for no-stringTypes-given in ve.ce.Surface, which just takes the first handled type it finds by looping over dataTransfer.items. I couldn\u0027t, however, see anything specifying the order those had to be in, so I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s actually reliable.\n\nI could maybe do something with either of these to make it generate the list of types, and then just push `text/plain`/`text/html` to the end of the list. In practice, that\u0027d probably work.\n\nThoughts?",
