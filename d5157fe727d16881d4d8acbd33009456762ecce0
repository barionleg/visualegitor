      "message": "We talked about this for the past days and collected possible concerns. Still we think this is a reasonable approach. For example:\n* This patch encodes knowledge about the Cite extension in the VE library. While this is technically \"the wrong way around\", it\u0027s a soft dependency. We made sure nothing bad can happen even in a worst-case scenario other than that we start tracking nonsense. We will fix or just remove the tracking in this case.\n* While it would be lovely to be able to do this kind of tracking in extensions/VisualEditor or ideally even Cite, it appears like the information we need (e.g. if the user pressed Ctrl+V) isn\u0027t available at these spots any more. Setting up extra instrumentation for this isn\u0027t worth it, in our opinion.\n* Before we invest more resources into this, we would like to start with this reasonably cheap experiment first.",
