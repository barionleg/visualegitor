      "message": "It might be possible to further optimize the runtime of this code, e.g. by moving the new identity check down here, or by swapping the two checks in line #67 and #71. But this depends on the real-world data that typically ends here, e.g. what the chance of the input being `â€¦.compareElementsUnannotated( [ sameObject ], sameObject )` is, or how often both are strings.\n\nI don\u0027t know if this is worth investing time in. Just a suggestion.",
