      "message": "It doesn\u0027t look conceptually right that this loop can call removeType multiple times with the same arguments. But the same is true of register calling addType multiple times with the same arguments, and obviously their behaviour needs to match. It will actually work, because removeType uses indexOf and splice to remove the startmost copy, but perhaps we shouldn\u0027t have duplicates in there at all. (It may be that types.length is always \u003c\u003d 1 in such cases, in which case it doesn\u0027t matter in practice).\n\nI suggest a comment both here and in register: either a TODO saying we should guard for multiple calls, or an explanation of why we don\u0027t need to.",
