      "message": "we might want to do -2 here as sometimes the word break algorithm takes into account 2 chars to see if it is a break.\n\nCurrently if I type L\u0027enyclopedie, this detects a break after the L in L\u0027. If we wait until two chars have passed, it wouldn\u0027t check that location until you typed L\u0027e, which has no breaks.\n\nWould need to consider if this has adverse effects.",
