      "message": "I think this should use \u0027aria-label\u0027 attributes rather than \u0027title\u0027. Apparently screen readers don\u0027t consistently handle \u0027title\u0027, and so it is not recommended. You can find some examples elsewhere in this repo, e.g. in in ve.ui.FindAndReplaceDialog.js:\n\n\tthis.replaceText \u003d new OO.ui.TextInputWidget( {\n\t\tplaceholder: ve.msg( \u0027visualeditor-find-and-replace-replace-text\u0027 ),\n\t\tvalue: ve.userConfig( \u0027visualeditor-findAndReplace-replaceText\u0027 ),\n\t\ttabIndex: 1\n\t} );\n\tthis.replaceText.$input.attr( \u0027aria-label\u0027, ve.msg( \u0027visualeditor-find-and-replace-replace-text\u0027 ) );\n\n\n(For ButtonWidget, you can also use config like `label: ..., invisibleLabel: true`.)",

      "message": "Thanks a lot for noticing. I did indeed miss this. However. I carefully checked and come to the conclusion that a title that creates a visible tooltip is the best option in all 4 cases.\n* The \"Size\" widget presents two input fields where the only difference is their order. While this should be obvious for most users, I think it\u0027s helpful when I have the option to hover the two fields and get a quick explanation of what each means.\n* The language widget just says that, \"Language\". But what it expects me to enter is a language code. Now a tooltip explains that. There are certainly other options to make this more obvious. But a visible tooltip feels like a quick and easy improvement for the existing UI.\n* The button currently shows three dots. I think a visible tooltip is almost a must in this case. Again, while there are many other options, this is a quick and easy improvement.\n\nI suggest to merge this as is. More improvements are possible, but shouldn\u0027t block this first step.",

      "message": "Adding a \u0027title\u0027 looks like a good idea, but I still think that this should be done in addition to \u0027aria-label\u0027, rather than instead of it. As far as I know, using \u0027title\u0027 for accessibility is a bad practice, and I\u0027d like to avoid us providing a bad example. It should be easy enough to do both in this patch.",

Why not just use \u0027aria-label\u0027, which always works in every application?\n\nIt\u0027s as if you were arguing to use `\u003d\u003d` instead of `\u003d\u003d\u003d` because you carefully considered all cases and you\u0027re sure it works correctly, and it saves one character. But why not just do it in the generally-accepted, well-understood way?\n\nAnyway, I don\u0027t want to argue about this further. I still think it\u0027s a bad approach, but it won\u0027t break the world, so I\u0027ll leave it up to you and the team to decide.",
