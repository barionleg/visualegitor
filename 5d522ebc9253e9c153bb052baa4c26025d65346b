I think most but not all the rigging for this is in place, but it\u0027s the way the system really aught to be setup.\n\nSomething like this:\n\nvar command \u003d ve.ui.commandRegistry.getCommandForNode( node );\nif ( command ) {\n    this.surface.execute( command );\n}\n\nThat way we can fully abstract what executing the command does and which nodes use which commands.",
