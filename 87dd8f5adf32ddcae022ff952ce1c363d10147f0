From what I can tell, a fragment of a ref-having document will always have origInternalListLength \u003e 0, but since internalList isn\u0027t cloned, trying to get the \"last\" node from the fragment should fail.",

I\u0027ll restore the code removed in my patch, and try to adapt it to this new case, including a test.",
