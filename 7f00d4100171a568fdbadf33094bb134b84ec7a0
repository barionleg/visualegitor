      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is right.  The intent of the test (as I recall) was to say that if html is included in addition to a text/uri-list type, *ignore the text/uri-list* and use the HTML, since the HTML includes a title for the link while the standard text/uri-list does not.  In this test case the pasteHTML deliberately uses a different URI, to make it clear(er) that the pasteString is completely ignored and the resulting expectedData is coming solely from the pasteHtml.\n\nThe next test refines this: if we get a text/x-moz-url (mozilla\u0027s extension), then use that directly, since Mozilla\u0027s extended format contains the desired title.\n\nThe previous case says that a bare text/uri-list, without corresponding HTML, should be treated like a wikitext barelink; that is, the title is the url.\n\nI clearly should have written better comments for these test cases.",
