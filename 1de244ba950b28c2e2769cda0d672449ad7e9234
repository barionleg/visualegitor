      "message": "This causes noncommutativity. Suppose (say) a \u003d \"insert \u0027foo\u0027 at 3\" and b \u003d \"set bold from 2 to 5\". Then applying b followed by a/b gives a bolded foo, whereas applying a followed by b\\a gives a non-bolded foo.\n\nMaking this consistent isn\u0027t just a matter of rebasing: it\u0027s also a question whether continuing insertions after rebasing should have an insertion annotation applied. That could get very complicated as the correct answer probably depends on the annotation stack.",
