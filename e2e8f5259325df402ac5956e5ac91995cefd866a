      "message": "The problem with that approach is that by the time root/unroot is emitted, you\u0027ve lost the old root. So it\u0027s not easy to call oldRoot.disconnect. This kind of timing issue is why I\u0027m an emit-sceptic ;-)\n\n- We could make new ve.Node events called preRoot/preUnroot or something.\n\n- Or this class could maintain another property called this.emittedRoot (or something), which would be a copy of this.root but updated slightly later (by the root/unroot listener).\n\nI think either of those approaches make the code more confusing, but let me know what you think.",
